    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Lasagna recipe's can be tricky. But not this one! For this recipe, we are
      essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with
      noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down: Start by making
      the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato
      sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes
      gives the sauce great depth of flavor. Let this simmer while you boil the
      noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded
      mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend
      gives the lasagna great flavor! From there, it's just an assembly job. A
      cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of
      cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the
      ingredients. Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
